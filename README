Apache::Mailtrack Version 0.03
==============================

Apache::Mailtrack assists you in keeping track of the response
generated by an HTML newsletter (supposedly - or shall I say,
hopefully - NOT SPAM), by logging all views of the newsletter (via
an embedded image, which is served by this module) and logging all
clicks on an URL (which gets also "served" by this module via
redirect) into a database capable of SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle,
and such).
